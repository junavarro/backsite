Personal website of mine, cv and info blog about hardware and coding.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository nd start to code.

### Prerequisites

By know the project only needs a text editor.

I use atom, to install it on debian based linux distros just [download it](https://atom.io/download/deb) and type on the terminal:
```
sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
```
For more details you can go to the [atom's page](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/).
